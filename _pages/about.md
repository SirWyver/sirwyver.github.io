Hi! I'm Norman, AI Researcher at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/ch/) in Zurich.
I completed my PhD at the [Visual Computing and Artificial Intelligence]((https://niessnerlab.org/)) group of [Prof. Matthias Niessner](https://niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), Germany. My work focuses on 3D generative models, 3D reconstruction and (dynamic) scene understanding.

Additionally, I hold a Master in Informatics as in Mathematics from the [RTWH](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/) Technical University of Aachen, Germany, graduating with high distinction and at the top of the class.

In the past, I have worked at BMW Munich in R&D for robotics/VR and did two internships with Peter Kontschieder from [Meta Zurich](https://www.meta.com/ch).
